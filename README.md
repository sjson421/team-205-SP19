### Project Description:
Users can initiate and retrieve a conversations with either one user or a group of users easily. They can have information about their communications partners at their fingertips, find people, and the like - all independent of any particular device. It doesn't matter if they are using a personal or public device, the system should work as if they
are in their office or at home.

### Team Meeting Schedule:
The team hosts daily scrum meeting over weekday -- 6:00pm on Wednesday/Friday; 3:30pm on Tuesday/Thursday and 8:30pm on Monday. We also meet on Saturaday to review past sprint and plan for the new sprint bi-weekly with class TA. When necessary, we schedule group working time throughout the week.
