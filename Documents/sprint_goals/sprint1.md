## Sprint 1 Goals

### Base Goals
- [x] We will have created our first backlog in Jira.  We will have created all backlog items.  Each person will have been assigned a backlog item.  Each person will have “worked” an item, moving it through the states until it’s closed.  The backlog will contain all the items described in this document.  We will have started the sprint in Jira.
- [x] We will have created a requirements document in our repository on Github. We will define the MUST, SHALL, MAY, MUST-NOT, and SHALL NOT requirements for the system.
- [x] We will have a UML diagram to document what our thoughts are for the design of the system and its key features. Our design should consider the MUST requirements. The UML diagram will also be pushed to Github
- [x] We will have documented the next sprint’s goals. Pending sprint review, we will add these goals to our backlog in Jira, and assign the tasks to different team members. We will also come up with a criteria for how many hours per person per week will be necessary to get an A, B, C, or lower.
- [x] We will demo our tests for the existing Prattle code. We aim to have at least 90% branch coverage and 90% condition coverage.
